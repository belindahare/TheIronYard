<p>The Eureka Diamond was found by a 15 year old boy that assumed it was just an pretty stone, he put it in his pocket and took it home to play with later.  His mother also found the stone interesting and showed it to her neightbor, who offered to buy it from her.  She declined the offer and gave it to him saying, "You can keep the stone it you want it."  It was the first diamond discovered in South Africa and in it's uncut condition weighed approximately 21.25 carats.  It stayed in it's rough condition for 100 years until De Beers purchased it, cut and polished it, and finally donated it to the South African people where it is on display at the Kimberley Mine Museum. <a href= "location.html">Kimberley Mine Museum<a/>
